# BetterCapsLock
Fixes caps lock occasionally not working when switching input source with it.
This is for the people who uses caps lock key to change input source.
- To enable "real caps lock" feature, instead of long pressing caps lock key, enter ```Shift + Caps Lock```.
- You can also use **right ⌘** to switch input source.

# Usage
## Common
1. Build & archive & put ```BetterCapsLock.app``` to ```Application``` directory. Or you can download pre-built application from [Releases](https://github.com/crowjdh/BetterCapsLock/releases).
   - There're zero dependencies, so I suggest you to build by yourself.
2. System Preferences > Secyrity & Privacy > Privacy tab
   - Add the application to ```Accessibility```

## For CapsLock users
- System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys...
  - Map Caps Lock to ```No Action```

## For right ⌘ users
